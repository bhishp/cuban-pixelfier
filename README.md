# Cuban Pixelfier

The Cuban Pixelfier is an art project that... pixelates cubans!

This project is a submission for the [cryptocubansocialclub](https://www.cryptocubansocialclub.com) art contest.

# Story

The CryptoCubans kicked-off an art contest for the launch of their NFT project but the problem is that I am not an
artist, but I can code. Additionally, the NFT world seems to like pixelated PFPs. So, I thought, what if real-life
CryptoCubans could become pixelated cubans? This led me to this project. The initial idea and scope was basically to
convert the image into a pixelated representation by an army of "crawlers", that will traverse the image and slowly
pixelate it, but challenges and ideas led to the code you see today.

There are **no** randomisations in this code, so given the same inputs and the same seed phrase, you will always receive
the same output image. Originally I designed it so the app would be totally driven by the seed, but I tought it would be
more fun to let you all choose the inputs and experiment.

This is my first attempt at "generative art" (does this even count?), I hope you enjoy it ✌️

# How to use it?

* Open the app on GitHub pages here:
* Play around with inputs and the seed phrase
* Look at art
